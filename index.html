<h3> Biography</h3>
<p> I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the University of Munich on Machine Learning, advised by Prof. Volker Tresp. During my PhD, I also spend time conducting research in Siemens Corporate Technology on Explainable AI. 
  
  My research interests include computer vision and machine learning. Especially, I am interested in the following topics:
  
  <ul>
	<li> Explainability of Deep Learning</li>
	<li> Robust Deep Learning (Adversarial Examples)</li>
	<li> Deep Generative Models (VAE and GANs)</li>
  </ul>
