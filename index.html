<h3> Biography</h3>
<p> I am a third-year Ph.D. student in <a href="http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">the University of Munich</a> on Machine Learning, advised by <a href="https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/">Prof. Volker Tresp</a>. During my PhD, I also spend time conducting research in <a href="https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/innovation.html">Siemens Corporate Technology</a> on Explainable AI. 
  
  My research interests include computer vision and machine learning. Especially, I am interested in the following topics:
  
  <ul>
	<li> Explainability and Robustness of Deep Learning </li>
	<li> Semi/Weakly/Self-supervised Learning </li>
	<li> Zero/One/Few-shot Learning </li>
	<li> Image Understanding with Cognitive Models </li>
  </ul>
